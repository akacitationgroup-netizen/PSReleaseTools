# Get-PSIssue

## SYNOPSIS

Get PowerShell issues from GitHub.

## SYNTAX

```yaml
Get-PSIssue [[-Since] <DateTime>] [[-Label] <String[]>] [[-Count] <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This function will query the Issues section of the PowerShell repository on GitHub. You can filter for issues updates since a given date. You can filter based on labels. You can also limit how many items to return. The minimum is 25.

NOTE: The function uses the GitHub API which has rate limits. If you attempt to run this command repeatedly, in a short period of time, you might exceed the rate limits. At which point you will have to wait for the limits to reset.

body        : Steps to reproduce

              "hello" > world
              Move-Item world CONOUT$

              Expected behavior

              Move-Item: Cannot process path 'C:\Temp\u\CONOUT$' because the target represents a reserved device

### Example 4

```Powershell
PS C:\> Get-PSIssue -count 150 | Sort-Object -property milestone | Format-Table -view milestone
```

Get 150 of the most recently updated issues and display the result in a formatted table grouped by milestone. Be sure to sort on the Milestone property before piping to Format-Table.

## PARAMETERS

### -Count

The number of results to return. The actual number of results you get back may vary depending on other parameters and how the GitHub API pages results. Think of this parameter value as more of an approximation instead of a hard count.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Label

Specify a comma-separated list of labels to filter with.
If you select multiple labels, the issue must have all of them. When the PSReleaseTools module loads, it should define a global variable called PSIssueLabel. This parameter has an auto-completer that uses this variable. If the variable isn't defined, if will be created by running Get-PSIssueLabel.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Since

Display issues updated since this time.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
